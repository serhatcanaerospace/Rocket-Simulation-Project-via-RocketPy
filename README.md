# Rocket-Simulation-Project-via-RocketPy
Rocket Simulation Project uses RocketPy to simulate rocket performance with Cesaroni M1670 motor data. It features thrust-time curves, drag analysis (power-on/off), and Google Earth trajectory visualization. The goal is to provide a reproducible workflow integrating experimental data and advanced simulation tools.
